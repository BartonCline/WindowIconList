Due to additions that essenially "brand" the Applet with dedicated Firefox functionality, breaking changes and slow development, I've forked https://github.com/jake-phy/WindowIconList/ prior to any commits by jake and others.
I've merged in some of the fixes provided by those contributors and will strive for a release in the near future.
